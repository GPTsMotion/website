For compliance and legal reasons. We may use Personal Data to comply with legal obligations, and it is in our legitimate business interests to use your Personal Data to defend us against legal claims or disputes, including to:

We also impose contractual obligations on service providers to ensure they can only use your Personal Data to provide services to us and to you.

Professional advisors: We may share your Personal Data with professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

Developers: Users who develop tools or extensions to publish on our store and/or contribute to the GPTsMotion open source community may have limited access to your Personal Data. We ensure all developers are subject to confidentiality obligations.

International Data Transfers
--------------------------
If you are based in the United States or anywhere else, we store your Personal Data primarily on servers in the United States. If you are based in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we primarily store your data in those regions. We may also transfer Personal Data to our service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for Personal Data and we will comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular by relying on an EU Commission or UK government adequacy decision/regulation for transfers outside of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom, or on contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Data. For more information about how we transfer Personal Data internationally, please contact us as set out in the "Contact us" section below.

How long your personal data will be kept
--------------------------
We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data. Generally, we store Personal Data until it is no longer necessary to provide the Service or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first.

When it is no longer necessary to retain your Personal Data, we will delete or anonymise it.

You may opt out of marketing-related communications by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions contained in the marketing communication we send you or by contacting us as provided in the "Contact us" section below.
